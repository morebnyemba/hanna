# These variables are exposed to your Vite/React application.
# Make sure the variable names (e.g., VITE_API_BASE_URL) match what is used in your frontend code.

# The base URL for the backend API.
# Your frontend will use this to make requests like login, fetching data, etc.
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://backend.hanna.co.zw

# The WebSocket URL for real-time communication (e.g., live chat updates).
# The client-side code will likely append the specific path (e.g., /ws/conversations/).
