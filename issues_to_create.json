    "body": "## Description\nCreate the foundational `InstallationSystemRecord` model that serves as the master object for tracking every installation throughout its lifecycle. Supports **all installation types**: Solar (SSI), Starlink (SLI), Custom Furniture (CFI), and Hybrid (SSI). This is THE core concept from the PDF that's currently missing.\n\n## Why Critical\nWithout ISR, we cannot achieve the strategic vision of an Installation Lifecycle Operating System. Every sale, installation, warranty, and service event should orbit around an ISR, regardless of installation type.\n\n## What to Build\n- New Django app: `installation_systems`\n- `InstallationSystemRecord` model with:\n  - Installation type field (solar, starlink, custom_furniture, hybrid)\n  - Fields for customer, order, system size/capacity, status, technicians, components, monitoring ID\n  - Flexible capacity units (kW for solar, Mbps for starlink, units for furniture)\n- Database migrations\n- Admin interface\n- Tests for all installation types\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Create `InstallationSystemRecord` model in new Django app `installation_systems`\n- [ ] Include installation type field (choices: solar, starlink, custom_furniture, hybrid)\n- [ ] Add system capacity with flexible units (kW, Mbps, units)\n- [ ] Create relationships to existing models (Order, Customer, InstallationRequest, SerializedItem, etc.)\n- [ ] Create database migrations\n- [ ] Add Django admin interface\n- [ ] Create REST API endpoints (CRUD)\n- [ ] Add role-based permissions\n- [ ] Write unit tests for all installation types\n\n## Reference\nSee `IMPLEMENTABLE_ISSUES_WEEK1.md` Issue 1 for full details.\n\n## Estimated Time\n3-4 days",

This enables controlled offerings where retailers sell only approved bundles.\n\n## Why Important\nThe PDF emphasizes retailers should \"sell only pre-approved system bundles to avoid undersizing risks.\" This provides standardization and quality control across all installation types.\n\n## What to Build\n- `SystemBundle` model with installation_type field (name, capacity, price, components, type)\n- `BundleComponent` model (links products to bundles)\n- Type-specific compatibility validation rules (solar: inverter+battery+panel, starlink: router+dish, etc.)\n- REST API endpoints for bundles with installation type filtering\n- Tests for all types\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Create `SystemBundle` model with installation_type field\n- [ ] Create `BundleComponent` model\n- [ ] Add compatibility validation rules for each installation type\n- [ ] Create REST API endpoints (list, filter, get, validate)\n- [ ] Add serializers with nested bundle components\n- [ ] Write API tests for all installation types\n\n## Reference\nSee `IMPLEMENTABLE_ISSUES_WEEK1.md` Issue 2 for full details.\n\n## Estimated Time\n2-3 days",

This applies to **all installation types**: Solar (SSI), Starlink (SLI), Custom Furniture (CFI), and Hybrid (SSI). This automates the first step in the \"Sale → ISR → Installation → Warranty\" pipeline from the PDF.\n\n## Why Critical\nThe PDF states: \"Every sale = an ISR is created instantly.\" This eliminates manual steps and ensures no installation goes untracked, regardless of type.\n\n## What to Build\n- Django signal handler on Order model\n- Installation type detection logic (from product keywords, bundles, categories)\n- Celery task for async ISR creation (all types)\n- Link ISR to Order, Customer, InstallationRequest\n- Extend email invoice processor to create ISR\n- Notification to admin when ISR created (specify type)\n- Management command to backfill existing orders (all types)\n- Tests for solar, starlink, furniture, hybrid\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Create Django signal handler for Order model\n- [ ] Implement installation type detection logic\n- [ ] Create Celery task for async ISR creation\n- [ ] Extend email invoice processor in `email_integration/tasks.py`\n- [ ] Add ISR field to InstallationRequest\n- [ ] Send admin notifications on ISR creation\n- [ ] Create management command to backfill existing orders\n- [ ] Write integration tests for all installation types\n\n## Reference\nSee `IMPLEMENTABLE_ISSUES_WEEK1.md` Issue 3 for full details.\n\n## Estimated Time\n3-4 days",
