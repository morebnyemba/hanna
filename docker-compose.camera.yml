# Optional Docker Compose override file for server-side camera device access
# 
# This file is NOT needed for normal operation. The frontend uses browser-based
# WebRTC APIs (navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia) to access client cameras.
#
# Use this override ONLY if you need server-side video device access for
# special purposes like:
# - CI/CD testing with virtual camera devices
# - Server-side video processing
# - Emulation environments
#
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.camera.yml up
#
version: '3.8'
