# HANNA - Installation Lifecycle Operating System

A comprehensive CRM and lifecycle management system with WhatsApp integration, Django backend, React dashboard, and Next.js multi-portal frontend. HANNA manages the complete installation lifecycle for **Solar (SSI)**, **Starlink (SLI)**, **Custom Furniture (CFI)**, and **Hybrid** installations from sales through installation, warranty, monitoring, and ongoing service.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and docker-compose installed
- DNS records configured for your domains
- Ports 80 and 443 accessible

### 1. Clone and Start Services

```bash
git clone https://github.com/morebnyemba/hanna.git
cd hanna
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Set Up SSL Certificates

```bash
./setup-ssl-certificates.sh
```

### 3. Access Your Application

- Dashboard: https://dashboard.hanna.co.zw
- Backend API: https://backend.hanna.co.zw
- Management: https://hanna.co.zw

## SSL Certificate Setup

The application uses Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates. The setup is fully automated:

```bash
# One-command setup (recommended for fresh installations)
./bootstrap-ssl.sh --email your-email@example.com

# Or manual setup
./setup-ssl-certificates.sh --email your-email@example.com

# Fix certificate directory issues (if nginx shows old/expired certs)
./fix-certificate-directory.sh

# Diagnose SSL issues
./diagnose-ssl.sh

# Troubleshoot browser warnings
./troubleshoot-ssl-warnings.sh
```

**Automatic Renewal:** Certificates are automatically renewed every 12 hours by the certbot container.

### Common SSL Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Browser shows certificate warnings | Run `./fix-certificate-directory.sh` |
| Nginx using wrong certificate directory | Run `./fix-certificate-directory.sh` |
| Certificate expired or self-signed | Run `./setup-ssl-certificates.sh --email your@email.com` |
| Staging certificate in production | See [SSL Configuration](docs/configuration/README_SSL.md) |

For detailed SSL setup and troubleshooting, see [docs/configuration/README_SSL.md](docs/configuration/README_SSL.md)

## Deployment

See detailed deployment guides in the [docs/configuration/](docs/configuration/) folder:
- **[Docker Configuration](docs/configuration/DOCKER.md)** - Docker setup
- **[SSL Certificate Setup](docs/configuration/README_SSL.md)** - SSL certificate configuration

## Troubleshooting

### SSL Certificate Issues

**Browser showing security warnings?** Run the quick diagnostic:

```bash
# Identify the issue (30 seconds)
./check-certificate-paths.sh

# Auto-fix certificate path issues
./fix-certificate-paths.sh

# Full diagnostic
./diagnose-ssl.sh

# View logs
docker-compose logs nginx
docker-compose logs certbot
```

**See [docs/troubleshooting/](docs/troubleshooting/) for common issues and fixes.**

### Migration Conflicts

If you see an error like:
```
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:
        whatsappcrm_backend/.../migrations/0001_initial.py
Please move or remove them before you merge.
```

This happens when migration files exist locally but aren't tracked by git. Run:

```bash
# Use the automated fix script
./fix-untracked-migrations.sh

# Then pull and migrate
git pull origin main
docker compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
```

**Manual fix:**
```bash
# 1. See untracked migration files
git status

# 2. Backup and remove each untracked migration file shown
#    (Replace paths with actual files from git status output)
mkdir -p /tmp/migration_backup
mv whatsappcrm_backend/*/migrations/*.py /tmp/migration_backup/  # or specific files

# 3. Reset to remote
git reset --hard origin/main

# 4. Rebuild and migrate
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
```

**For inconsistent migration history errors, see:** `./fix-migration-history.sh`

### Service Issues

```bash
# Check all services
docker-compose ps

# View service logs
docker-compose logs <service-name>

# Restart services
docker-compose restart
```

### Domain Not Accessible

1. Check DNS: `dig dashboard.hanna.co.zw`
2. Check firewall: Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open
3. Check nginx: `docker-compose logs nginx`
4. Run diagnostics: `./diagnose-ssl.sh`
