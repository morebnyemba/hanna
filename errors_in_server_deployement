22.51 > Build error occurred
22.52 Error: Turbopack build failed with 1 errors:
22.52 ./proxy.ts
22.52 Proxy is missing expected function export name
22.52 This function is what Next.js runs for every request handled by this proxy (previously called middleware).
22.52 
22.52 Why this happens:
22.52 - You are migrating from `middleware` to `proxy`, but haven't updated the exported function.
22.52 - The file exists but doesn't export a function.
22.52 - The export is not a function (e.g., an object or constant).
22.52 - There's a syntax error preventing the export from being recognized.
22.52 
22.52 To fix it:
22.52 - Ensure this file has either a default or "proxy" function export.
